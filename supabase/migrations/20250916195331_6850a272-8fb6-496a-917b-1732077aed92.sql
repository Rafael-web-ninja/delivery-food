-- Fix security vulnerability: Restrict public access to delivery_businesses table
-- Only allow public users to see essential business information, not sensitive data

-- Drop the existing overly permissive public policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view active businesses" ON public.delivery_businesses;

-- Create a new restricted policy that only exposes necessary fields for customers
-- This policy will work by allowing public access but RLS will still apply column-level restrictions
-- when combined with proper SELECT statements in the application code

-- For now, we'll create a view that exposes only safe fields and update the policy to reference it
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.public_business_info AS
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  description,
  phone,
